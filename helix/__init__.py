# pkgutil shenanigans to make python load helix.third_party from site-packages
#
# tl;dr helix.third_party contains some executables for windows and is installed
# from another pypi package (helix-3rd-party).
# When importing helix.third_party from any files inside Helix, python will expect
# to find helix.third_party INSIDE this package and not in site-packages. Code
# below will make this package a "Native Namespace Package" (PEP 420) and will
# make it possible to have different packages contributing to the same namespace
# (helix). Only downside is the the IDE won't recognize helix.third_party, which is
# not a big deal as it doesn't contain any python code.
