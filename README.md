This is my attempt to improve [WGSE](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev). Still under heavy development. Don't expect anything working.

- [PyPi Package](https://pypi.org/project/WGSE-NG/)
- [Documentation](https://wgse-ng.github.io/)

Follow [this](https://t.me/WGSENG) very low traffic telegram channel if you don't want to miss any updates on WGSE-NG (the channel is managed by [WGSE-NG Telegram bot](https://github.com/WGSE-NG/TelegramBOT)).

### Launch
The only currently supported way to install `WGSE-NG` is with a pypi package.

```bash
sudo apt install libqt6waylandclient6 samtools bcftools -y # Only for Linux
python -m pip install wgse-ng
wgse
```

NOTE: See the [doc](https://wgse-ng.github.io/) for troubleshooting and for developer/user guides.
